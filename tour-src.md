# Surveillance infrastructure walking tour

**Note: this material is a work in progress.**

## Introduction

As we walk around downtown Seattle, we'll refer to this [field guide](https://www.figma.com/file/C15vnW0gtZybtY24eXREfy/Field-Guide-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1). Map and photos coming soon.

## Surveillance cameras

As we walk around downtown, we'll see many surveillance cameras—and they'll see us.

### Overview

How do you think a surveillance camera sees you? 

It's not hard to get a sense of how a person sees you. The more you get to know a person, the more you get a sense of how they feel about you through what they do and say. If they like you personally, or they hold a prejudice against some part of who you are, it'll likely come out in conversation.

A surveillance camera, though an unblinking and unbreathing machine, _also_ sees you in a certain way. All the hardware and software of the camera, as well as the people "inside" the camera, together encode a certain kind of gaze. Based on what they see, they might act toward you in some way. But unlike a person, there's no two-way flow of information, and no explanation for something that happens.

Cameras have always seen some people better. More broadly, sensors have always been built by certain groups of people to sense certain groups of people better than others.[^audio] In her book "Darkness Matters," Simone Browne argues that biometric technology privileges whiteness and is troubled by "dark matter":

> Dark matter being those bodies and body parts that trouble some biometric technology, like dark irises or cameras that "can’t see black people" or that ask some Asian users, "Did someone blink?" When particular surveillance technologies, in their development and design, leave out some subjects and communities for optimum usage, this leaves open the possibility of reproducing existing inequalities. (163)

[^audio]: For an example in another medium, see: [A Century of “Shrill”: How Bias in Technology Has Hurt Women’s Voices](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-century-of-shrill-how-bias-in-technology-has-hurt-womens-voices)

And seeing and sensing have always been used as forms of control, especially over black and brown bodies. As Browne writes, "some light shines more brightly on some than on others... [and some] technologies of seeing [seek] to render the subject outside of the category of the human, _un_-visible." (68)

_Question:_ How do you think a surveillance camera sees you? What have you experienced in Seattle?

Just walking around, we've been spotted by many surveillance cameras watching us. But again, a surveillance camera is not a person. 

_Question:_ How does a surveillance camera differ from an eye? How does a surveillance camera differ from a random passerby looking at you?

Let's get specific about the hardware, software, and people operating it. (several answers included below)

* The camera has a memory. It can record video or other data and add it to a store of records over all time. That data can be analyzed for patterns and shared with other entities, both private (your neighbors) and public (the local police).
* The people behind the camera tend to have _more_ power than the average person in public space (security guards or police).
* The camera can be controlled remotely: it can swivel, zoom, or change height.
* It might be connected to a network (via Internet or radio frequency), which lets it send video to anywhere, receive instructions from anywhere, and lets other people, who might be anywhere, watch the video stream.
* The camera might be insecure; that is, anyone on the network could break into it.
* The camera can see things an eye can't, such as temperature and infrared frequencies.
* There might be many cameras connected to the same network in a city or building, sharing information (e.g. tracking the same person).
* The camera can have different ways of seeing encoded in it, including kinds of gazes that enforce social agreements about what kinds of behavior and people are considered "normal"—and these gazes can be propagated all at once to the whole network of enforcement that the camera hooks into.
* There are many more cameras in public space than one might expect: 500,000 in London, 30,000 in Chicago, 9,000 in New York, 46,000 in Beijing (and growing very fast in China to 600 million+ by 2020).

_Question:_ Now that we've broken down why a camera is not an eye, what do you all think is a better way to understand a street-level video surveillance system?

To understand surveillance, we also need to _watch_. Let's try and get a sense of that. 

_Question:_ Who's watching? What's it like on the other side? Has anyone here worked as a security guard? Can you tell us about your experience? What can a camera see, and what did *you* see? 

The people who are watching can see a lot. Often data is piped to centers in cities called "real-time crime centers" to be displayed and analyzed. (Possible activity: _You're the voyeur_)

> "The biggest thing I’ve come across over the years working security is how much people think they can get away with things, or operate under the assumption that there aren’t cameras in an area, or the cameras aren’t recording. Which, to be fair, that’s sometimes the case. But 99 percent of the time, if they’ve done something stupid, it’s probably on camera. A control center operator has probably seen it or has been asked to look into it and found it."

One recent example of seeing as a form of control was when the Seattle Police Department installed a SkyWatch tower in a parking lot in a Safeway in South Seattle, a heavily Japanese neighborhood. According to Stanley Shikuma, a board member of the Japanese American Citizens League’s Seattle chapter, this tower sends a clear message: "You are being watched. We have you in our sights. And like [at] the [Japanese internment] camps, the intent is to intimidate rather than protect."

Coverage of this tower pointed out the police's use of surveillance, which they justified by pointing to high crime rates, was just a _band-aid_ on symptoms that arose from the underlying issue of a _destruction of community._

> The Silver Fork was a place to get hot links, grits, a middling cup of coffee and the company, mostly Black, of your neighbors and community leaders. It made the space feel activated, vibrant and safe, the kind of place you wouldn’t mess with because it was familial.
> 
> But Safeway replaced the restaurant with a gas station and convenience kiosk. 

This story shows how we can resist the _way of thinking_ that props up the practice of surveillance. Justifications like "crime" are really symptoms of deeper causes that only will only be _exacerbated_ by imposing coercive technologies from the top down. Instead, we can imagine and build futures that decenter control and center community.

In general, widespread video surveillance systems threaten individuals' privacy, anonymity, and freedom of movement, and they're vulnerable to abuse by people and institutions. They're expensive systems that aren't proven to "stop crime" or make people feel safer. The risks far outweigh the benefits!
<!-- TODO: more concrete stories/citations -->

One way that activists have resisted these systems is by "watching the watchers." Groups in cities including NYC, LA, Chicago, and Seattle have worked on photographing surveillance cameras and mapping their locations, to make a usually opaque system more transparent to the public. We could join in that action right now as well. (Possible activity: _Spy v. Spy_)

<!-- TODO: more social history discussion; also legal status -->

### Activities

_Spy v. Spy_: First, discuss the [field guide to spotting surveillance cameras](http://www.coveillance.org/camera-spotting), which gives more concrete details on kinds of cameras, how to spot them, and where they are usually found. Next, split up into pairs. Each pair competes to find, photograph, and map the most surveillance cameras in downtown. (Of course, be aware of your surroundings, be safe, be prepared for questions, and only photograph cameras in outdoor public space. Yes, what we're doing is legal.)

Discussion

* Did it feel subversive? Should it feel subversive? How can citizens hold surveillance systems accountable?

_You're the voyeur_: Look at [unsecured security cameras](https://www.insecam.org/en/bycity/Seattle/) in Seattle on Insecam. 

Discussion

* Do any places look familiar? How does it feel to perform watching? What ways of seeing are you imposing? Is this ethical?

### Discussion

* What are other ways to question the need to have cameras, or surveillance, at all? What sort of society would we build around this way of life?
* What are your individual or communal experiences of "light shining more brightly on some than others"?
* What if each camera were replaced by a person? How would that change how you feel?
* Are you okay with being surveilled by cameras in public space? (Some large percent of Americans is okay with this.)
* What is the relationship between a city's architecture and the ways that it affords or hinders watching? (The panopticon is canceled.)

## Amazon Go

Visit Amazon Go, [a surveillance-powered convenience store](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/) at 2131 7th Ave, as well as the Seattle Spheres.

### Overview

Amazon Go is a convenience store without cashiers. Instead, cameras track your every move inside the store to determine what objects you’ve taken from the shelf, as well as your browsing habits, such as how long you hesitated before taking an item or whether you put an item back.

Is it a big deal if Amazon knows that you like bagels over waffles? Well, maybe not in and of itself. But be aware of a few things. First, Amazon is probably combining your data from the physical Amazon Go store with data about your online purchases. Say you’ve bought an item that reveals your political or religious beliefs—Hillary Clinton’s book, a Hanukkah decoration—and you also get a coffee every day at 8am. Now Amazon knows about your beliefs and where to reliably find you. What happens if those beliefs become persecuted? [e.g., raids on Muslim-Americans].

Second, once Amazon has your data, you’ve implicitly consented to whatever they want to do with that data. One way data is often used is to draw conclusions for advertisements. Ads have the power to shape individual beliefs and behavior—think about how teenage girls are affected by ads depicting impossible beauty standards. Targeted ads, which show ads based on your purchases and behavior, has an echo chamber effect, where the things you see reinforce your beliefs, which reinforces what Amazon shows you.

We don’t necessarily know how else data is being used, because there is little legal oversight. Can Amazon sell this data to the government? Can Amazon track your location, based on what stores you go to? What if Amazon is accidentally storing your data insecurely, and an employee can access it? Can Amazon use the photo of your face to generate other face photos? All of these situations have happened in the past.

Amazon Go is a tradeoff between convenience and surveillance. Day-to-day, surveillance is a mostly invisible price to pay, but it has the power to shape individual behavior as well as society. 

### Discussion

* How have advertisements affected you or shaped your beliefs?
* What are the societal effects of targeting ads based on [race, gender]?
* When you go into Amazon Go, what do you imagine you are consenting to? How does this differ from the reality? How could this be changed?
* If you were Amazon, what would you do with the data you collect? 
* Quote from article: "It’s a bit overkill, I think, to replace a checker or self-checkout stand with a hundred cameras that unblinkingly record every tiny movement. What’s to gain? 20 or 30 seconds of your time back?"

## AT&T peering site (NSA wiretap site)

Visit *1122 3rd Avenue*, a site for AT&T peering and one of the NSA's eight wiretap rooms in the FAIRVIEW surveillance program.

### Overview

This stop on the tour highlights surveillance at the federal level, how surveillance relies on cooperation between the private and public sectors, and the dragnet quality of digital surveillance.

AT&T handles a lot of data. According to _The Intercept_, "As of March 2018, some 197 petabytes of data – the equivalent of more than 49 trillion pages of text, or 60 billion average-sized mp3 files – traveled across [AT&T]'s networks every business day." Because AT&T's so big, it's called a Tier 1 provider, so other networks exchange their network capacity with AT&T (called "peering") or pay AT&T to transmit traffic on its network (called "transit"). The way that two networks peer is that their infrastructure physically meets in a building, often via an Ethernet switch in a carrier hotel or a "meet-me room," so data can be exchanged between the networks. That's what's happening in this building and in the Westin Exchange.

So, even if your Internet service provider isn't AT&T and you don't live in the US, if your provider peers with AT&T anywhere in the chain, your emails and Facebook messages might enter AT&T's network, onto US soil, into one of the AT&T peering hubs, where NSA equipment can siphon it off to Maryland to be stored, processed, collated against your profile and that of people you know. 

The NSA is able to spy on massive amounts of Internet traffic passing through the US because of its partnership with AT&T, even lauding AT&T's "extreme willingness to help." The NSA can read non-US citizens' communications with impunity. For example, the NSA has used its wiretap hub in NYC (called Titanpointe) to eavesdrop on the phone communications of the United Nations, the World Bank, and at least 38 countries, including allies like Germany, Japan, and France. However, there are regulations against reading US citizens' communications.

The eight NSA hubs, or AT&T peering rooms, for FAIRVIEW are in Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Dallas, DC, and Atlanta. Is NSA equipment still in this building, intercepting communications that pass through Seattle and funneling it to Maryland for NSA analysts to look at? Yeah, probably. Incidentally, this location is very close to both the FBI Seattle office and the Pacific-1 intercontinental undersea cable.

### Discussion

* If you were in AT&T's role, or you worked at AT&T, what would you do if the NSA came knocking and asked you to install its wiretapping equipment? 
* In the apparatus of surveillance, should it make a difference whether someone is a US citizen?
* How does it feel to be physically close to a central portion of federal/international internet/surveillance infrastructure through which a massive amount of information is flowing?

### Overview

Heinrich Bolle story about the counter

> I certainly have not agreed for the city of Seattle or any vendors to track the position of my phone as it moves throughout the city whether or not that data is properly anonymized.

Consent? Did you agree to this?

trash can tracks your address

Say what a MAC address is
MAC address -- name passing by -- make diagram of car with phone passing by routers, calling out for networks and sending a packet with its name

> The marketing materials don't say this, but it might also be possible to attach specific attributes to the MAC addresses that are collected. A phone that goes into the women's room probably belongs to a female, for instance, while a MAC address entering the Big and Tall clothing retailer probably belongs to a person of large carriage. People who don't want to be tracked must first complete the form here, which requires them to divulge the MAC address of their smartphone.

Why does wi-fi work this way?? It's a very insecure protocol!

How to protect against: turn off wifi

Why was it installed? Traffic monitoring. Knowing what's in a city. Much more detailed than bluetooth readers

Privacy issues: The new system works because cellphones and tablets have their own identifying numbers called media access control or MAC addresses. As you drive down Mercer Street or 2nd Ave or 23rd, it can tell that it's the same device pinging the string of antennas at the streetlights.

It's actually not clear how strong the crypto is! Compare it to tracking people by their social security numbers... then dropping all the slips of paper on the floor

> The new system will provide a much more detailed picture: while Bluetooth readers capture 5-7 percent of cars passing intersections, the Wi-Fi readers capture nearly 50 percent from cars with smartphones or tablets with Wi-Fi turned on.

> As the car passes more readers, algorithms are run to calculate speed, distance, time and general behavior.

But have alternatives like a plate

What could go wrong? Data fusion + storage + retention, subpoena'd data, others run queries on it, scope creep.

Larger trend: private companies sell smart technologies to knowledge-hungry cities. 
<!-- Bonnie cite -->

Tradeoffs: is there a tradeoff? Why not use a more secure alternative? This is _surveillance thinking_ again: it's either this or the "bad old days," no evidence that this works either.

> In this case, the ultimate question may be what concerns people more: the specter of overly surveillant law enforcement, or the prospect of spending yet another hour stuck in traffic?

## Automated license plate reader

Visit an automated license plate reader (ALPR). Location TBD. There are 99 static LPRs installed throughout the city. They are [PIPS P372 cameras](http://www.pipstechnology.com/fixedalpr/).

### Overview

Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR), unsurprisingly, capture the license plates of cars that drive by. License plates are important because they uniquely identify a person—the government can look up who a license plate belongs to at a DMV. They are posted in street corners around Seattle. There is no public map, since the city doesn’t want to lose money from people evading speeding tickets.

Well, if you’re not speeding, so what? First, ALPRs take pictures of your license plate even when there are no traffic violations. According to the city of Seattle, this is to keep track of traffic congestion. Second, with ALPRs located in many places around the city, the government could conceivably track your location, or the location history of any given person. Where you go can reveal a lot about you and can be used against you—for example, the NYPD collected license plates of people parked at mosques, in an "unapologetic approach to protecting the city from terrorism." Third, who gets access to this data, and how is it stored? Although Dept. of Transportation employees receive "training" to use the system, what prevents a malicious user from tracking their ex-partner, and is there any oversight? Currently, there is no legal requirement to audit or delete this data. 

### Discussion

* What legal requirements, if any, should there be around use and retention of this data?
  * View Insecam where [license plates can be seen](https://www.insecam.org/en/view/793365/). 
* What analog solutions exist to measure congestion on roads and give out speeding tickets, that don’t involve privacy violations?
  * For example, weight plates or magnetic coils on roads.
* Say we banned ALPRs and have worse traffic/congestion. What do you think of the tradeoff?
* How do license plate readers compare to cameras that take pictures of faces in terms of privacy?
* What motivates governments to surveill; in this case, to install ALPRs?
  * Possible talking point: economic incentives at odds with citizens’ best interests
* Note: they can be both mounted on police cars (mobile) and on public infrastructure (static)
* Discuss the relationship between convenience and surveillance again, and less-invasive alternative technologies for achieving the same goals
* Discuss the dragnet nature of surveillance (e.g. license plate numbers used to track members of Muslim and immigrant communities) and insecurity (e.g. cameras accessible online)
