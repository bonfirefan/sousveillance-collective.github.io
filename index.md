# A field guide to spotting surveillance cameras

This is a guide to training yourself to visually recognize when you're on camera, as well as helping us gather a dataset to use for training a machine learning model to recognize surveillance cameras in photos and video.

## Tips for visually spotting surveillance cameras

Before you start, read the [EFF guide to surveillance cameras](https://www.eff.org/pages/surveillance-cameras) and James Bridle's experience [photographing surveillance cameras in London](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/lens/surveillance-camera-photography.html).

Cameras are often spotted on poles, ledges, overhangs, rooftops. They are often spotted watching parking lots, doors, banks, intersections, and government buildings. Indoors, they are typically spotted on roofs and near cash registers. They are typically positioned right above human height or very far above it. The box that is often seen near a camera is an infrared light for night vision. 

Often several cameras clump together, so if you see one, look for more.

Be aware of local kinds of cameras, for example in New York, and of new kinds of cameras. One new kind of camera is the Amazon Ring.

Several cities have maps of camera locations, but they may be outdated.

Be aware that sometimes a camera is positioned as a deterrent, and does not actually work! Also, even if a camera works, no one may be watching.

TODO: what is a camera's field of view?

## Practice

Here are some practice images. (TODO)

## Other ways to detect cameras

NOTE: Do not employ any of these methods if they are illegal where you live.

Signals

Insecam or iSpy

Portscanning: IP Scanner, Net Analyzer, or some command-line utility

## Taking good images to use in a machine learning model
