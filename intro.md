# How does surveillance work?

## Notes to the instructor

This material aims to provide an accessible toolkit for surveillance awareness and action. It's written to be short and memorable, so it centers on a question-and-answer approach that incorporates case studies, narratives, visual illustrations, bullet points, openings for conversation and collaboration, and practical exercises.

The material aim to address participants' pressing personal questions as well as contextual questions. Here are the personal questions we aim to address:

* Why should I care about surveillance?
* How am I being surveilled?
* How am I surveilling?
* How does surveillance affect me?
* What kind of privacy can I expect from the status quo?
* How should I think about surveillance?
* How should I respond to mainstream surveillance narratives?
* What steps can I take to protect my privacy?
* What can I do about surveillance?
* How can I learn more about surveillance?

And here are the contextual questions that provide background for the personal questions:

* What is surveillance?
* Why does privacy matter?
* How does modern surveillance work?
* How has surveillance evolved over the last few centuries?
* Why do we surveil?
* Does surveillance work?
* Who benefits from surveillance?
* Who is harmed by surveillance?
* Why are things the way they are?
* What are the key issues with surveillance?

Finally, here are the key learning objectives:

* Understand the causes and effects of surveillance, as well as the main actors
* Understand some of the technical basis of how surveillance works in personal devices and everyday life
* Go through technical exercises to increase personal privacy
* Understand how to take collective action socially and legally
* Build concrete skills in spotting surveillance infrastructure in everyday life

# Introduction

Imagine you're at a dinner party with friends. Over drinks, you start talking about the news.

"I can't believe someone hacked Tinder?! Better change my password."
"So apparently there's been another NSA leak...."
"Zuckerberg was definitely lying in court."
"So I heard the NYPD uses facial recognition now?"
"Dude remember when we talked about yogurt yesterday? I just got an ad for Dannon on Instagram today. Were they listening??"
"In case you missed it: Russian hackers are stealing our faces!"

Sound familiar? How do you continue the conversation?

*Discuss*: Solicit candid answers from participants about media narratives of surveillance.

I'm glad we worked together to put together this list. As you know, headlines about surveillance dominate the news. When the conversation comes to surveillance, it's easy to pull out these pithy little soundbites:

“Big brother’s watching!" 
“If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”
"We live in a reality TV show!"
"We live in a real-life panopticon."
"Privacy is dead."
"Everyone's a voyeur."
"Oh, I was just talking to the FBI agent in my webcam."
"Where's my tinfoil hat?"
"Love it when tech breaks democracy"
"It's just like in _Black Mirror_"

Where did these soundbites come from? In most cases, nowhere in particular. But it feels like you hear them repeated everywhere. These ways of thinking are _surveillance tropes_ to watch out for. And these little slogans reinforce the message that we, as a public, feel like surveillance is something that's done to us and that we're powerless to stop. Like crabs in slowly-boiling water, we say these things so we can stop thinking about the water's rising temperature.

Our goal today is to talk about water. Let's work together to build a fresh understanding of surveillance. First, let's talk about the ways that we experience watching.

*Discuss*:
* What brought you here today?
* Why do you care about privacy?
* Why does privacy matter?

*Facilitator prompts*:
* Goal: suss out definitions of surveillance and privacy.
* Why do you use the bathroom with the door shut and locked?
* Would you give me your email password and let all of us look at your email and post excerpts online?
* Can you recall a time when you watched someone by accident?
* Can you recall a time when you felt like someone you didn't expect was watching you?
* When do you expect to be able to watch someone?
* When do you expect not to be able to watch someone?
* When do you expect someone to be watching you?
* When do you expect someone to not be watching you?

Glenn Greenwald gave a powerful defense for privacy in his talk "Why privacy matters": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcSlowAhvUk

> "There is an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to an experience which I'm certain everyone in this room has had. It entails an individual who, thinking they're alone, engages in some expressive behavior--wild singing, gyrating dancing, some mild sexual activity--only to discover, in fact, that they're not alone, that there is a person watching and lurking, the discovery of which causes them to immediately cease what they were doing in horror. The sense of shame and humiliation in their face is palpable. It's the sense of, 'This is something I'm willing to do only if no one else is watching."

> Privacy is the "ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us, in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside. And that is why, when we allow a society to exist where we are subject to constant monitoring, we allow the essence of human freedom to be severely crippled."

Now that we've talked about surveillance and privacy in the abstract, let's get more concrete. Let's talk about how we're actually being surveilled. (The following questionnaire and article are adapted from "SuperVision.")

> Are You Under Surveillance?
> Let’s do a quick check. Do you have any of these?
> 	* a cell phone
> 	* a credit or debit card
> 	* an identification card
> Do you do any of these?
> 	* use Google, Gmail, or Facebook
> 	* go to school
> 	* have a job
> 	* drive a car
> If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you are under surveillance.

> To begin rethinking your cell phone from a surveillance perspective, just imagine this (totally fake) news report: 

> Washington. In legislation signed by the president, the United States government mandated that all citizens carry an electronic device providing live-streamed data on their location, communication activity, and personal interactions. Data banks will constantly record the time, duration, sender, and receiver of all telephone calls and electronic transmissions, while targeted investigations will be able to monitor actual conversations and message content. Cross-analysis of multiparty location records will show patterns of personal interaction and association. The new program also creates what one official called “300 million eyes” by requiring that each of the mandated devices be equipped with an advanced digital camera able to record and document evidence and transmit it to authorities. 

> Officials from police, national security, and public health and safety agencies heralded the move. In the words of one, “This brings an end to the darkness. We can now better serve our citizens with a universal capacity to know where everyone is, all the time. We’ll know who they’re with, who they talk to, when they move, and where they go. This is a massive improvement in our ability to control disease, crime, and terrorism.” To offset the cost of the program, each citizen will be required to pay a monthly fee. 

Let's take this trend to the extreme. If institutions like the state and companies knew everything about us, what would they do with that information? The film "Minority Report" proposed one possible future.

(Show three clips from "Minority Report")

"PreCrime: a world with no murder" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQdDLfD3kls
"Minority Report Trailer 2" (When PreCrime goes wrong) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__oEU4P_rL8
"Minority Report: the future of personalized advertising" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bXJ_obaiYQ

When do you think this film was made? It was actually made 17 years ago, in 2002, when Google barely existed (it was founded in 1998) and before Twitter even existed (it was founded in 2006). The film predicted the future so well because Spielberg directed his advisors to think about the trends in *how tech was being used*.

*Discuss*:
Would you support PreCrime?
In what ways does the film reflect reality today, or not?

## How am I being surveilled in my daily life? Using stories to map surveillance

Let's tell some stories about your information and what happens to it. We'll use these stories as a way to make a map of how surveillance works--how all the parts fit together and the ways we can grasp how it works.

_Note_: (For the facilitator) The idea is to encourage participants to develop a shared understanding by developing a shared representation of the visual metaphors we can use to get a mental foothold on surveillance. After each story, discuss what the story is meant to illustrate, what entities to add to the map, and how these entities relate to what's already on the map. Ideally everyone would have a pen and paper, and the facilitator would work on a whiteboard that everyone could see.

First, let's start with some common stories about you--how you volunteer your information and thus make yourself visible to various watchers.

You get an Android phone because everyone has one, or it makes life easier, or you need to get one for work.
You join Facebook because all of your friends are there and you want to know what's happening. When you visit a new city, you post your location on Facebook so you can find friends.
You get a Google Home because it makes life easier.
You let your Android phone track your location in real-time, which lets you use services like Uber and Google Maps.
You let your Apple Watch track your heart rate while running. It analyzes that data and gives you insights about trends in your health.
You let the _Guardian_'s website store cookies in your browser, which they say lets them recommend products and serve ads that are more relevant to your interests.
You upload a picture of your face to FaceApp or Google Art Selfie or Snapchat, which serves you a fun picture of your face (aged, or compared to a painting, or gender-swapped) which you send to your friends.
You let the TSA pat you down at the airport.

_Note_: These stories are picked to be more approachable because they illustrate voluntary surveillance (or self-surveillance) via the consumer-tech entities that most participants should be familiar with. Use the opportunity to introduce a visual grouping for "You" and another one for platform companies (the surveillance capitalists). Also, discuss how "You" become visible to the watchers through your data.

These are all examples of _voluntary_ surveillance: you know what information you're giving out. Now let's discuss some other stories about surveillance---some you might not have experienced, some about surveillance under duress, using information you didn't consent to giving up, using processes opaque to the people caught up in them. They are all real stories or composites of real stories.

You log on to Facebook and take a personality quiz. It tells you you’re an INTJ. Later, you see some pretty good ads for a local congressional candidate, and decide to learn more about them.

_Note_: This is an entry point to this whole story that people should have vaguely heard of: "The Data That Turned the World Upside Down: How Cambridge Analytica used your Facebook data to help the Donald Trump campaign in the 2016 election." https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win The point is to introduce a relationship between private entities and public entities, to introduce the idea of public-private collusion, and to introduce the idea of many small pieces of information being used for a much huger emergent purpose (i.e. that of undermining democracy).

You search for baby formula on Google, then visit Target’s site. They send you mail with a coupon that reads "Congratulations on the baby!" You're still living with your parents, who are Puritans who you were trying to keep a secret from. They kick you out of the house. 

_Note_: This is the famous "Target knows you’re pregnant before your parents do" story. It serves as an entry point to surveillance capitalism and predictive behavior influencing.
https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/06/big-data-whats-even-creepier-than-target-guessing-that-youre-pregnant.html

You have an Android phone and you go about your daily life. The Feds issue a geofence warrant to Google to get your location data. They suspect you of murder and arrest you based on the data.

_Note_: This is another pathway to public-private collusion, as well as discussing data storage/longevity issues and issues of scope creep.

You live in San Francisco, and you spend a nice day out at the Brainwash cafe. Unbeknownst to you, the camera in the cafe recorded your face. Stanford researchers tap into the camera installed in the cafe and grab all the face images to create a dataset, which is then used in China by to develop surveillance technology for monitoring and persecuting ethnic minorities.

_Note_: This is an entry point to the role of facial recognition and AI in surveillance, as well as how data is 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/technology/databases-faces-facial-recognition-technology.html

You’re out with your family and you take a bunch of nice photos, which you upload to Flickr.
An IBM researcher scrapes your photo from Flickr and uses it to train a facial recognition model, technology that it sells to the NYPD so it can “search CCTV feeds for people with particular skin tones or hair color.”
https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921

You try to fill out a Google form, but first it asks you to click on some photos to identify the pedestrians.
Your efforts are used to train self-driving cars in Google’s Waymo division.

You talk with your spouse about hardwood floors. Or you sing badly in the shower. You have an Alexa in the home. 
Your conversation is recorded and transmitted by accident: https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/25/614470096/amazon-echo-recorded-and-sent-couples-conversation-all-without-their-knowledge
Or perhaps it is transmitted to workers who listen and transcribe it: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio

You’re out in the city, walking to different places in a mall. You pause by a froyo store, but walk on. You later get an emailed coupon for a discount on yogurt.
Bluetooth beacons and MAC address trackers in the mall ping your phone, identifying you uniquely from the list of wifi networks you have, and they know what stores you want to (e.g. Victoria’s Secret), for how long, and with who.
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html?rref=collection%2Fseriescollection%2Fnew-york-times-privacy-project
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/no-this-isnt-a-scene-from-minority-report-this-trash-can-is-stalking-you/

You drive around the city to several destinations: to work, to dinner, to your partner’s place.
Your license plate is recorded by every ALPR you pass on the way; your MAC address is recorded by every Acyclica device you pass along the way; this data is stored by private and public entities (both the city and the companies that manufacture these devices) and sent to quasi-private entities for analysis, like Palantir. Let’s say you’re an immigrant--the city of Union City shares your location data with ICE, which uses your location info to deport you. https://www.aclunc.org/blog/documents-reveal-ice-using-driver-location-data-local-police-deportations

You install a free “ruler” app on your iPhone.
It records your real-time location and sells it to a data broker, which targets you with ads.

You’re out on the roof with your partner at night, enjoying a warm and intimate evening. Nobody can see you here, right?
Unbeknownst to you, an NYPD helicopter is spying on you with thermal imaging. 
https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/nyregion/police-video-caught-a-couples-intimate-moment-on-a-manhattan.html

You are a US citizen on US soil. You visit the website of someone who is alleged to be a foreign suspect. Your request passes through your ISP (?), then AT&T, where it is intercepted by an NSA wiretap, sent to Maryland, and caught in XKEYSCORE by an NSA analyst. A predictive system uses this risk factor to put you on a no-fly list.

## How modern surveillance works

*Discuss*: the final map. How to think about it.

Here is one possible map of the anatomy of surveillance: https://www.figma.com/file/C15vnW0gtZybtY24eXREfy/Field-Guide-Prototype?node-id=75%3A0

One possible metaphor to understand surveillance is as a huge octopus with many arms, with the public being many tiny fish, and your personal data being like air bubbles.

Alternatively: Surveillant assemblage
There's no big brother, no single watcher. Not the panopticon. 
The "surveillant assemblage": takes an individual out of context into portable data. 
"shifting, moving observation presentation, and regulation of the self by countless measures in countless locations"
	e.g. your cell phone. 
roots, coral, rhizome. Picture here
We're all watching each other.

Who benefits from surveillance
The combination of private, public, public/private
Your information is gathered and pooled
Surveillance capitalism

Why things are the way they are:

Think: If you could know X about Y. So easily--with a search. Could you know? Would you want to know? 
What if someone wanted to know X about you?
Now you understand the impulse to surveil.

Surveillance comes about because of a perfect storm, tne result of an information-seeking society.
The drive to quantify, measure, record, compare, assess
Everyone wants to know more, and the more you can know, the more you expect to be known and to know!

Surveillance is big business: "recession-proof"

"Today’s organizations both require and create orderly, systematic knowledge about the people and things they govern or manage. Surveillance is in the DNA of the modern organization. Businesses, governments, universities, even individuals, seek to gather and organize information as an ongoing part of their work. It’s simply part of what we’re expected to do as responsible actors. Think about how many of our contemporary ideologies or value systems celebrate unfettered access to information. Science must have its data. Law must have its witnesses and confessions. Religion has its all-knowing deities. Democracy has its transparency. Rationality must have its perfect information. They all want to know more! This is a unique cultural alignment in which our key value systems unite to push us toward the celebration and advancement of surveillance as a means of social organization and control. In the face of this level of government, corporate, and ideological convergence in favor of advancing surveillance, we are skeptical that the flood can be pushed back. But we might be able to make it a bit more fair, transparent, and accountable."

Driven by fear and desire

## Does surveillance keep me safe?

For who?
For you: 
For the watchers: 

"If it doesn't really keep us safe, why do we tolerate it?"

## What can I do about surveillance?

(They Are Watching)

Responses to mainstream surveillance narratives

Situation: a technology is often posited as inevitable (CCTV cameras) and then the scope creeps
Practical response: can we think of a cheaper, more private, analog, scope-limited way to accomplish the real effect?
Case study: CCTV vs. street lighting

Situation: If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
Practical response: ?
Case study: ?

General creepiness
Imbalance of power
Inability to opt-out
Data fusion and collation
Coercive nature of data-gathering
Data longevity
Scope creep
Shifting terrain
Chilling effect
Unclear policies
Lack of accountability
Selling your identity (past, fears, and hopes) for money
Influencing your behavior
Amplification of social bias
Targeted toward marginalized groups
It doesn't work!

Surveilance is about an **Imbalance of power**: you don't have databse access, algo transparency, EULA, policy. 
"Surveillance characterizes almost all aspects of social life but most surveillance is undemocratic"

Work to raise expectations for the protection of personal data, opt-out instead of opt-in, keep info in its original context

Fight for transparency
And interrogate your own urge to know

## What steps can I take to protect myself against surveillance?

 What kind of privacy can I expect? I heard something about "the right to be forgotten."

EXERCISE: Look at tracking cookies in Chrome. Clear your cookies.

Use Jumbo for a privacy checkup.
Block tracking online: use Adblock, Ghostery
Periodically clear your cookies and browsing history
Use secure email and communications (protonmail, Signal)
Use a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo
Use an iPhone instead of an Android phone
Lock down your location on your phone
Audit your authorized services on platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter
Use a password manager
Use the most restrictive settings on your smart home (e.g. turn off voice recording)
Turn off your auto-wifi joining
Don't join public wifi
Make sure your browsing is locked down: look for HTTPS (the lock icon in the browser)
At the more extreme, you might use a secure OS like Tails, or a secure browser like Tor.
