# Watching the watchers: a workshop

![](media/bbox3.png)

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to identifying how you're being watched in daily life. The goal is to cut through paranoia and hype by demystifying how technologies like AI and networking work, then building practical skills in defending yourself against being watched. We will work together to understand what information our personal devices reveal about us, take a walk to identify surveillance infrastructure in the places around us, and build a community-driven AI to identify surveillance cameras in images.

The workshop would run 2-3 hours:

* 15 mins: group discussion
* 30 mins: background and introduction to large-scale AI-powered surveillance systems and how they encroach on civil liberties globally
* 1 hour: community walk to spot and photograph surveillance cameras and other infrastructure in public space
* 30 mins: collaborative labeling of surveillance cameras in the dataset we created
* 15 mins: group discussion + overview of ways to continue taking action

Additional topics that we can go over, depending on participant interest:

* How does your smartphone know how to recognize your face and voice? Introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence
* If you're connected to wifi, sending messages, or just walking around with your phone, what information can snoopers learn about you? Demonstrating packet sniffing with Wireshark
* When you're browsing the web, what information do websites store about you? Exploring tracking cookies

The community walk will draw on the [field guide to spotting surveillance cameras](field-guide.html) and the Seattle part of the [Who's watching you?](whos-watching.html) page.

The ML/AI material might cover some of the topics outlined [here](ai-intro.html).

The personal consumer tech material will draw on the second half of the [Who's watching you?](whos-watching.html) page.
